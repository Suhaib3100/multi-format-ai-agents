Subject: URGENT: Service Outage Complaint

Dear Support Team,

I am extremely frustrated with the recent service outage that has affected our business operations. We have been experiencing downtime for the past 48 hours, and this is completely unacceptable. Our clients are threatening to leave, and we are losing significant revenue.

This is the third time this month that we've had issues with your service. I demand immediate attention and compensation for our losses.

Best regards,
John Smith
CEO, TechCorp Inc.
